# 🌿 Prevention of Air Pollution by Predictive Planting of Trees

A machine learning-based approach to reduce air pollution by recommending optimal tree species and planting locations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses **predictive modeling** to analyze air pollution data and recommend tree planting strategies tailored to specific geographic locations and pollutant levels. The goal is to **combat air pollution** through data-driven decision-making in urban and rural planning.

By identifying the most effective trees for absorbing pollutants like CO, NO₂, PM2.5, and SO₂, this model suggests where and what to plant — making green interventions more efficient.

## 🧠 Core Features

- ✅ **Random Forest Regressor** trained to predict pollution severity.
- 🌱 **Tree recommendation system** based on:
  - Pollutants absorbable by each tree species
  - Maximum tree height
  - Pollutants absorbed per tree
  - Geographical feasibility
- 📊 **Hyperparameter tuning** for model optimization.
- 📉 **Model evaluation** using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- 📍 Location-based filtering for practical tree planting.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)
